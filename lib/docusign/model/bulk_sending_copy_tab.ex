defmodule DocuSign.Model.BulkSendingCopyTab do
  @moduledoc """
  A tab associated with the bulk send recipient. In a bulk send request, each recipient tab must match a recipient tab on the envelope or template that you want to send. To match up, the `tabLabel` for this tab and the `tabLabel` for the corresponding tab on the envelope or template must be the same.  For example, if the envelope has a placeholder text tab with the `tabLabel` `childName`, you must assign the same `tabLabel` `childName` to the tab here that you are populating with that information.
