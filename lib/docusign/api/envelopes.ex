  Search for specific sets of envelopes by using search filters.
  This method lets you [search for envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/search/) in your accounts. A large set of filters let you narrow the scope of your search by date, by envelope ID, or by status codes. Your request must include one or more of the following parameters:  * `from_date` * `envelope_ids` * `transaction_ids`  ### Restrictions  The number of envelopes returned is limited to 1,000 per call. To retrieve the next or previous set of envelopes, use the `nextUri` and `previousUri` parameters returned in the original call's response.  If no `from_date` query parameter is specified, envelopes from more than two years ago will not be returned. To fetch older envelopes, set the specific date range using the `from_date` and `to_date` parameters.  To avoid unnecessary database queries, the Docusign signature platform first checks requests to ensure that the filter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response before querying the database.  ### Envelope statuses  This table shows the valid current envelope statuses (`status` parameter) for the different status qualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the request. If the status and status qualifiers in the API request do not contain any of the values shown in the Valid Current Statuses column, then an empty list is returned.  Client applications should check that the statuses (`status` parameter) they are requesting make sense for a given `from_to_status` parameter value.  | Status Qualifier<br>(`from_to_status`) | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                                                      | | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | any (changed)                          | StatusChanged              | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted | | created                                | Created                    | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted | | sent                                   | Sent                       | any, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted          | | delivered                              | StatusChanged              | any, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                | | signed                                 | StatusChanged              | any, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                           | | completed                              | Completed                  | any, completed, declined, voided, deleted                                   | | declined                               | StatusChanged              | any, declined, voided, deleted                                              | | timedout<br>always return zero results | StatusChanged              | any, voided, deleted                                                        | | voided                                 | Voided                     | any, voided, deleted                                                        | | deleted                                | StatusChanged              | any, deleted                                                                |  ### Extraneous results  In some cases, a request for a specific envelope status will include envelopes with additional statuses. For example, in a request with a `from_date` of 2017-01-01, a `to_date` of 2017-01-07 and the status qualifier (`from_to_status`) set to `delivered`, the response set might contain envelopes that were created during that time period, but not delivered during the time period. As a workaround, check the envelope status values in the result set as needed.   ### Related topics  - [Searching for envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/search/) - [How to list envelope status changes](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/list-envelope-status-changes/)

Although you can use any date format supported by the .NET system library's [`DateTime.Parse()`][msoft] function, Docusign recommends using [ISO 8601][] format dates with an explicit time zone offset. If you do not provide a time zone offset, the method uses the server's time zone.  For example, the following dates and times refer to the same instant:  * `2017-05-02T01:44Z` * `2017-05-01T21:44-04:00` * `2017-05-01T18:44-07:00`  If this property is not included, envelopes from the last two years will be returned.

The default value is `Changed`.  Valid values: * `Changed` * `Voided` * `Created` * `Deleted` * `Sent` * `Delivered` * `Signed` * `Completed` * `Declined` * `TimedOut` * `Processing` 
    - `:include` (String.t): Specifies additional information to return  about the envelopes. Use a comma-separated list, such as `folders, recipients` to specify information. Valid values are:  - `custom_fields`: The custom fields associated with the envelope. - `documents`: The documents associated with the envelope. - `attachments`: The attachments associated with the envelope. - `extensions`: Information about the email settings associated with the envelope. - `folders`: The folders where the envelope exists. - `recipients`: The recipients associated with the envelope. - `payment_tabs`: The payment tabs associated with the envelope.

    - `:search_text` (String.t): Free text search criteria that you can use to filter the list of envelopes that is returned.
    - `:start_position` (String.t): The zero-based index of the result from which to start returning results.  Use with `count` to limit the number of results.  The default value is `0`. 
    - `:status` (String.t): A comma-separated list of current envelope statuses to be included in the response. Valid values:  * `completed` * `created` * `declined` * `deleted` * `delivered` * `processing` * `sent` * `signed` * `timedout` * `voided`  The `any` value is equivalent to any status. 
    - `:to_date` (String.t): Specifies the date and time to stop looking for status changes. The default is the current date and time.

For example, the following dates and times refer to the same instant:  * `2017-05-02T01:44Z` * `2017-05-01T21:44-04:00` * `2017-05-01T18:44-07:00`   [msoft]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.parse?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=net-5.0#overloads [ISO 8601]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 
    - `:transaction_ids` (String.t): A comma-separated list of envelope transaction IDs.  Getting envelope status by transaction IDs is useful for offline signing situations to determine if an envelope was created or not. It can be used for the cases where a network connection was lost before the envelope status could be returned.  **Note:** Transaction IDs are only valid in the Docusign system for seven days. 
    - `:user_filter` (String.t): Returns envelopes where the current user is the recipient, the sender, or the recipient only. (For example, `user_filter=sender`.) Valid values are:  - `sender` - `recipient` - `recipient_only`
    - `:user_id` (String.t): The ID of the user who created the envelopes to be retrieved. Note that an account can have multiple users, and any user with account access can retrieve envelopes by user_id from the account.
    - `:user_name` (String.t): Limit results to envelopes sent by the account user with this user name.  `email` must be given as well, and both `email` and `user_name` must refer to an existing account user.

  Creates an envelope.
  Creates and sends an envelope or creates a draft envelope. Envelopes are fundamental resources in the Docusign platform.   With this method you can:  * Create and send an envelope   with [documents][], [recipients][], and [tabs][]. * [Create and send an envelope from a template](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/). * [Create and send an envelope from   a combination of documents and templates](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/composite/). * Create a draft envelope.   When you use this method to create and send an envelope in a single request, the following parameters in the request body (an [`envelopeDefinition`][envelopeDefinition] object) are required:  | Parameter      | Description | | :--------      | :---------- | | `status`       | Set to `sent` to send the envelope to recipients.<br>Set to `created` (or don't set at all) to save the envelope as a draft. | | `emailSubject` | The subject of the email used to send the envelope. | | `documents`    | The [documents][] to be signed. | | `recipients`   | The email addresses of the envelope [recipients][]. |   When you create an envelope by using a [composite template](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/composite/), you should specify the envelope custom fields in the inline template. Any custom fields that you specify at the root level are ignored.  If the envelope has a workflow definition and the `workflowStatus` is `paused`, the envelope will not be sent immediately, even if the envelope's `status` is `sent`.   ### Related topics  [Envelope][envelopes] and [template][templates] objects along with [documents][documents], [recipients][recipients], and [tabs][tabs] are the five object models at the core of the eSignature API.

  ### Parameters

  - `connection` (DocuSign.Connection): Connection to server
  - `account_id` (String.t): The external account number (int) or account ID GUID.
  - `opts` (keyword): Optional parameters
    - `:cdse_mode` (String.t): Reserved for Docusign. 
    - `:change_routing_order` (String.t): When true, users can define the routing order of recipients while sending documents for signature.
    - `:completed_documents_only` (String.t): Reserved for Docusign. 
    - `:merge_roles_on_draft` (String.t): When **true,** template roles will be merged, and empty recipients will be removed. This parameter applies when you create a draft envelope with multiple templates.

  Send, void, or modify a draft envelope. Purge documents from a completed envelope.
  This method enables you to make changes to an envelope. You can use it to:  * [Send a draft envelope](#sending-a-draft-envelope) * [Void an in-process envelope](#voiding-an-in-process-envelope) * [Modify a draft envelope](#modifying-envelope-email-information) * [Purge documents and envelope metadata from the Docusign platform](#purging-documents-from-docusign)  Although the request body for this method is a complete envelope definition, you only need to provide the properties that you're updating.  ## Sending a draft envelope  To send a draft envelope, include the following code in the request body:  ```json {   \"status\": \"sent\" } ```  You can attach a workflow before sending the envelope:  ```json {   \"status\": \"sent\",   \"workflow\": {     \"workflowSteps\": [       {         \"action\": \"pause_before\",         \"description\": \"pause_before routing order 2\",         \"itemId\": 2,         \"triggerOnItem\": \"routing_order\"       }     ]   } } ```  ## Working with workflows  To unpause a workflow, the request body should include this:  ```json {   \"workflow\": {     \"workflowStatus\": \"in_progress\"   } } ```  ## Voiding an in-process envelope  To void an in-process envelope, include the following code in the request body:  ```json {   \"status\": \"voided\",   \"voidedReason\": \"The reason for voiding the envelope\" } ```  ## Modifying envelope email information  To change the email subject and message of a draft envelope, include the following code in the request body:  ```json {   \"emailSubject\": \"new email subject\",   \"emailBlurb\": \"new email message\" } ```  ## Purging documents from Docusign  To place only the documents in the purge queue, leaving any corresponding attachments and tabs in the Docusign platform, set the `purgeState` property to `documents_queued`.  ```json {   \"envelopeId\": \"222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca\",   \"purgeState\": \"documents_queued\" } ```  To place documents, attachments, and tabs in the purge queue, set the `purgeState` property to `documents_and_metadata_queued`.  ```json {   \"envelopeId\": \"222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca\",   \"purgeState\": \"documents_and_metadata_queued\" } ```  To place documents, attachments, and tabs in the purge queue and to redact personal information, set the `purgeState` property to `documents_and_metadata_and_redact_queued`.  ```json {   \"envelopeId\": \"222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca\",   \"purgeState\": \"documents_and_metadata_and_redact_queued\" } ```  You can purge documents only from completed envelopes that are not marked as the authoritative copy. The user requesting the purge must have permission to purge documents and must be the sender or be acting on behalf of the sender.  When the purge request is initiated the items to be purged are placed in the purge queue for deletion in 14 days. The sender and all recipients with Docusign accounts associated with the envelope get an email notification the documents will be deleted in 14 days. The notification contains a link to the documents. A second email notification is sent 7 days later. At the end of the 14-day period the documents are deleted from the system. Recipients without Docusign accounts do not receive email notifications.  If your account has a Document Retention policy, envelope documents are automatically placed in the purge queue, and notification emails are sent at the end of the retention period. Setting a Document Retention policy is the same as setting a schedule for purging documents.  ## Removing documents from the purge queue  To remove documents from the purge queue, include the following code in the request body:  ```json {   \"envelopeId\": \"222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca\",   \"purgeState\": \"documents_dequeued\" } ```  ### Related topics  - [Void an envelope](https://www.docusign.com/blog/dsdev-common-api-tasks-void-an-envelope) ([Common API Tasks](https://www.docusign.com/blog/tags/common-api-tasks)) - [Purging documents (eSignature Concepts)](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/documents/purging/) - [Purging documents in an envelope (blog post)](https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/purging-documents-envelope) - [How to unpause a signature workflow](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/unpause-workflow/)

  Returns document page images based on input.
  Returns images of the pages in a document for display based on the parameters that you specify.

  ### Parameters

  - `connection` (DocuSign.Connection): Connection to server
  - `account_id` (String.t): The external account number (int) or account ID GUID.
  - `document_id` (String.t): The unique ID of the document within the envelope.  Unlike other IDs in the eSignature API, you specify the `documentId` yourself. Typically the first document has the ID `1`, the second document `2`, and so on, but you can use any numbering scheme that fits within a 32-bit signed integer (1 through 2147483647).   Tab objects have a `documentId` property that specifies the document on which to place the tab. 
  - `envelope_id` (String.t): The envelope's GUID.   Example: `93be49ab-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-f752070d71ec` 
  - `opts` (keyword): Optional parameters
    - `:count` (String.t): The maximum number of results to return.
    - `:dpi` (String.t): The number of dots per inch (DPI) for the resulting images. Valid values are 1-310 DPI. The default value is 94.
    - `:max_height` (String.t): Sets the maximum height of the returned images in pixels.
    - `:max_width` (String.t): Sets the maximum width of the returned images in pixels.
    - `:nocache` (String.t): When **true,** using cache is disabled and image information is retrieved from a database. **True** is the default value. 
    - `:show_changes` (String.t): When **true,** changes display in the user interface.
    - `:start_position` (String.t): The position within the total result set from which to start returning values. The value **thumbnail** may be used to return the page image.

  ### Returns

  - `{:ok, DocuSign.Model.PageImages.t}` on success
