# DocuSign Elixir Client - Future Improvements

This document contains ideas for meaningful improvements to the DocuSign Elixir client based on analysis of the Ruby client and production needs.

## High Priority Improvements

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 2. Collection Parameter Formatting

**Description**: Support for different parameter collection formats
**Ruby features**: CSV, SSV, TSV, pipes, multi
**Implementation**:

```elixir
def format_collection_param(values, format \\ :csv)
```

### 3. Content-Type Negotiation

**Description**: Automatic content type handling and negotiation
**Features**:

- JSON/XML response handling
- Accept header management
- Content encoding support

### 4. Webhook Support Enhancements

**Description**: Improve existing webhook functionality
**Features**:

- Multiple signature algorithms
- Event filtering
- Batch event processing
- Dead letter queue support

## Architecture Principles to Maintain

### Keep Superior Elixir Patterns

1. **Behavior-based OAuth design** - More extensible than Ruby's monolithic approach
2. **Req-based HTTP client architecture** - Modern, composable request/response pipeline
3. **GenServer-based token management** - Better concurrency than Ruby's stateful client
4. **Supervision tree integration** - Leverage OTP fault tolerance

### Avoid Ruby Anti-patterns

1. **Monolithic client classes** - Keep separation of concerns
2. **Global state management** - Use process-local state
3. **Synchronous-only operations** - Support async where beneficial

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality

- All new features must include comprehensive tests
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Use Elixir idioms over direct Ruby translations
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Documentation

- Add typespecs for all public functions
- Include usage examples in module docs
- Update README with new features
- Create LiveBook examples for complex features

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual modules
- Integration tests with DocuSign sandbox
- Property-based testing where applicable
- Use Bypass for HTTP mocking

## Long-term Vision

The goal is to make the Elixir DocuSign client:

1. **Feature-complete** with the Ruby client
2. **More robust** through OTP patterns
3. **Better documented** with interactive examples
4. **More maintainable** through clean architecture
5. **Production-ready** for high-scale applications

While maintaining the clean, functional programming approach that makes the Elixir client superior in design to the Ruby implementation.
